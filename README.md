I'm a full-stack software engineer student with a flair for innovative solutions. I'm very concerned with the way design feels and the overall user experience. As a software developer, I plan to focus on improving the user experience as I learn more about visceral, behavioral, and reflective processes. I'm starting my career search and would love to find work remotely or in Charlotte, NC. I am ready for a relocation! My ideal job would be working front-end as a UX engineer, but I am open to learning anything and finding my niche as I go :)
